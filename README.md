# Differential Gene Expression with Respect to Noncanonical NF-kB Signaling Pathways

When downloaded, `Analysis.html` provides all necessary information regarding this differential gene expression analysis. In summary, I performed differential gene expression analysis using bulk RNA-seq data from Henry et al. (2018). The paper of reference is titled "CDK12-Mediated Transcriptional Regulation of Noncanonical Nf-ÎºB Components Is Essential for Signaling."

The original RMarkdown file as well as the bibliography are located in the "scripts" folder. The "doc" folder contains the list of generated DEGs as well as the results from a Gene Ontology analysis. The "data" folder contains a compressed .Rds file with the data analyzed in this project.
